### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate backend software developer who loves learning and building new things. I love open-source and collaborating. You can sometimes find me streaming on Twitch under the **Software & Game Development** category.

Find me also, on:

I mostly use Elixir with sometimes-necessary JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend things. However, I'm also interested in learning Rust, Go, and game development, and will probably stream part of those journeys as well.
