### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate backend software developer who loves learning and building new things. I love open-source and collaborating. You can sometimes find me [streaming on Twitch](http://twitch.tv/ShyRyan) under the `Software & Game Development` category. I mostly use Elixir with the sometimes necessary JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend things. However, I'm also interested in learning Rust, and Go, and will probably stream part of that journey as well.
